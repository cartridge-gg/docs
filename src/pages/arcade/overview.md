## Key Features

### ðŸŽ® Register a Game

Game studios can register a game freely, without needing permission.
When creating a game for the first time, youâ€™ll be asked to provide its metadata and define at least one Game Edition.

:::info
A Game Edition is a version of your game â€” it can be deployed on mainnet, testnet, or represent a season or special mode (e.g., Season 1, Mainnet, Playtest, etc.).
:::

When you register a game or an edition, an NFT representing its ownership is minted.
This NFT grants you admin rights over the game or edition.
You can update the metadata of your game or any edition at any time â€” including name, description, icon, image gallery, video, and more.
