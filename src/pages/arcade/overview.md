## Key Features

### 🎮 Register a Game

Game studios can register a game freely, without needing permission.
When creating a game for the first time, you’ll be asked to provide its metadata and define at least one Game Edition.

:::info
A Game Edition is a version of your game — it can be deployed on mainnet, testnet, or represent a season or special mode (e.g., Season 1, Mainnet, Playtest, etc.).
:::

When you register a game or an edition, an NFT representing its ownership is minted.
This NFT grants you admin rights over the game or edition.
You can update the metadata of your game or any edition at any time — including name, description, icon, image gallery, video, and more.

### 🧩 Create and update Game Editions

You can create new editions of your game at any time — each edition gets its own ownership NFT.
As the game owner, you control which editions are visible or hidden.
As the edition owner, you can choose to publish or hide your edition from public view.
