title: Controller Getting Started
---

# Getting Started

Controller implements a standard StarkNet account interface and can be seamlessly integrated into your application like any other wallet.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is to install the controller package and connect to Cartridge:

```ts twoslash
import Controller from "@cartridge/controller";

const controller = new Controller({});
const account = await controller.connect();

// You're ready to execute transactions!
```

When `connect()` is called, users will see an improved controller creation interface with username autocomplete functionality. As users type their username, they'll see matching existing accounts with user profiles, making it easier to connect to existing controllers or choose unique usernames for new accounts.

:::info
Controller will set **essential cookies** as part of the initialization.
These are necessary for the controller to function properly.
:::

## Installation

```bash
npm install @cartridge/controller starknet
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to initialize and use the controller:

### Without session policies

```ts
import Controller from "@cartridge/controller";

// All transactions will require manual approval
const controller = new Controller();
```

:::note
When no policies are provided, each transaction requires manual user approval through the Cartridge interface.
This is suitable for simple applications or testing, but games typically benefit from using [session policies](#with-session-policies) for a smoother experience.
:::

### With session policies

Pass session policies to the Controller constructor to enable gasless transactions and pre-approved transactions.

```ts
import Controller from "@cartridge/controller";
import { SessionPolicies } from "@cartridge/controller";

const policies: SessionPolicies = {
  contracts: {
    // Your game contract
    "0x1234...": {
      name: "My Game Contract",
      methods: [
        { name: "move_player", entrypoint: "move_player" },
        { name: "attack", entrypoint: "attack" },
      ],
    },
  },
};

// `move_player` and `attack` txs will not require approval
const controller = new Controller({ policies });
```

### With custom configuration

The Controller ships with sensible defaults for chain RPCs, but you can override them if needed.

```ts
import { constants } from "starknet";
import Controller from "@cartridge/controller";

const controller = new Controller({
  // Optional chain configuration
  chains: [
    { rpcUrl: "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/sepolia" },
    { rpcUrl: "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet" },
  ],
  defaultChainId: constants.StarknetChainId.SN_MAIN,
});
```

## Standalone Authentication

The Controller provides a standalone authentication method that opens the keychain in first-party context for seamless cross-game authentication. This is particularly useful for gaming ecosystems where users need to access multiple games with the same controller account.

### controller.open(options?)

Opens the keychain in standalone mode for authentication, establishing first-party storage access.

```ts
controller.open({
  redirectUrl: "https://your-game.com"  // Optional: URL to redirect after auth
});
```

#### OpenOptions

```typescript
type OpenOptions = {
  /** The URL to redirect to after authentication (defaults to current page) */
  redirectUrl?: string;
};
```

### Use Cases

The standalone authentication flow is designed for:

1. **Cross-game authentication**: Users authenticate once and can seamlessly access multiple games
2. **First-party storage establishment**: Ensures the controller can access storage across different domains
3. **Gaming ecosystem integration**: Smooth transitions between launcher and games

### Example: Game Launcher Integration

```tsx
import Controller from "@cartridge/controller";

const controller = new Controller();

// Check if user has first-party storage access
const hasAccess = await controller.hasFirstPartyAccess();

if (!hasAccess) {
  // Redirect through standalone auth to establish first-party storage
  controller.open({
    redirectUrl: "https://your-game.com"
  });
} else {
  // Direct navigation - user already authenticated
  window.location.href = "https://your-game.com";
}
```

This pattern is commonly used in gaming platforms where a launcher needs to authenticate users before redirecting them to specific games.

## Connectors

Connectors provide standardized integrations of Controller into various types of applications.

### Controller Connector (Web Applications)

The `ControllerConnector` provides a standard way to integrate with frontend frameworks like `starknet-react`.

```tsx
import React from "react";

import { constants } from "starknet";
import { sepolia, mainnet } from "@starknet-react/chains";
import { StarknetConfig, jsonRpcProvider, cartridge } from "@starknet-react/core";

import { SessionPolicies } from "@cartridge/controller";
import { ControllerConnector } from "@cartridge/connector";

const policies: SessionPolicies = {
  // Define session policies here
};

// Create the controller connector
const controller = new ControllerConnector({
  policies,
});

// Configure the JSON RPC provider
const provider = jsonRpcProvider({
  rpc: (chain) => {
    switch (chain) {
      case mainnet:
      default:
        return { nodeUrl: "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet" };
      case sepolia:
        return { nodeUrl: "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/sepolia" };
    }
  },
});

// Create the Starknet provider
export function StarknetProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <StarknetConfig
      defaultChainId={mainnet.id}
      chains={[mainnet, sepolia]}
      provider={provider}
      connectors={[controller]}
      explorer={cartridge}
    >
      {children}
    </StarknetConfig>
  );
}
```

#### Wallet Standard Integration

By default, the Controller exposes the `StarknetWindowObject` interface.
However, the ControllerConnector also supports the [get-starknet wallet standard](https://get-starknet.vercel.app/), enabling integration with libraries like `starknet-react` and `solid.js`.

You can use the ControllerConnector to cast `Controller` to the wallet-standard compatible `WalletWithStarknetFeatures` interface:

```tsx
import { ControllerConnector } from "@cartridge/connector";
import type { WalletWithStarknetFeatures } from "@starknet-io/get-starknet-wallet-standard/features";

// Now compatible with any library that expects WalletWithStarknetFeatures
const controller: WalletWithStarknetFeatures = (new ControllerConnector()).asWalletStandard();
```

:::warning
The `asWalletStandard()` method is an experimental feature and may contain bugs.
Please [report any issues](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/controller/issues) you encounter.
:::

### Session Connector (Native Applications)

The `SessionConnector` enables native applications to create local sessions linked to a user's existing Controller account.

:::tip
To learn more about native application workflows, read our [native application guide](/controller/native-integration.md).
:::

:::info
Under-the-hood, `SessionConnector` returns a `SessionProvider`, an alternative Controller implementation designed for native application.
For web application use-cases, use the regular `Controller` instead.
:::

```tsx
import { constants } from "starknet";

import { SessionPolicies } from "@cartridge/controller";
import { SessionConnector } from "@cartridge/connector";

const policies: SessionPolicies = {
  // Define session policies here
 };

const sessionConnector = new SessionConnector({
  policies,
  rpc: "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet",
  chainId: constants.StarknetChainId.SN_MAIN,
  redirectUrl: typeof window !== "undefined" ? window.location.origin : "",
  // Optional: specify keychain URL for custom deployments
  keychainUrl: "https://x.cartridge.gg",
});
```

### Migration Notes for v0.10.0

#### StarkNet v8 Breaking Changes

If you're using `WalletAccount` directly in your application, you'll need to update the constructor call:

```ts
// Before (v0.9.x)
const account = new WalletAccount(provider, address, signer);

// After (v0.10.0)
const account = new WalletAccount({
  nodeUrl: provider,
  address: address,
  signer: signer
});
```

#### Ethereum Wallet Integration Changes

The MetaMask SDK has been removed in favor of the EIP-6963 standard. If your application relied on MetaMask SDK-specific features:

- Wallet detection now uses EIP-6963 standard wallet detection
- All Ethereum wallets are now handled through a shared base class
- This change improves bundle size and wallet compatibility

#### Lodash Removal

The lodash dependency has been completely removed. If you were importing lodash utilities from this package, you'll need to replace them with custom utilities or install lodash separately in your application.

## Development Workflow

If you're contributing to the Cartridge Controller or running the examples locally, you have two development modes available:

### Local Development Mode

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs all services locally with local API endpoints, perfect for offline development and testing changes to the controller itself.

### Production API Testing Mode

```bash
pnpm dev:live
```

This hybrid mode runs the keychain and examples locally while connecting to production APIs.
The `dev:live` mode provides production RPC endpoints, Auth0, Stripe, and Turnkey configurations while keeping the keychain frame at `localhost:3001` and your application at `localhost:3002`.

:::warning
The `dev:live` mode connects to production APIs, so be careful with any transaction testing as it will use real network resources.
