# Configuration

Controller provides several configuration options related to chains, sessions, and theming.

## ControllerOptions

```typescript
export type Chain = {
  rpcUrl: string;
};

export type ControllerOptions = {
    // Chain configuration
    chains?: Chain[];  // Custom RPC endpoints for slot katana instances
    chainId?: string;  // hex encoded
    
    // Session options 
    policies?: SessionPolicies;  // Optional: Session policies for pre-approved transactions
    propagateSessionErrors?: boolean;  // Propagate transaction errors back to caller
    
    // Customization options
    preset?: string;  // Preset name for custom themes and verified policies
    slot?: string;  // Slot project name for custom indexing
};
```

The configuration options are organized into several categories:

-   **Chain Options**: Core network configuration and chain settings
-   [**Session Options**](/controller/sessions.md): Session policies and transaction-related settings
-   **Customization Options**: [Presets](/controller/presets.md) for themes and verified policies, [Slot](/controller/inventory.md) for custom indexing

## When to Use Policies

**Policies are optional** in Cartridge Controller. Choose based on your application's needs:

### Use Policies When:
- Building games that need frequent, seamless transactions
- You want gasless transactions via Cartridge Paymaster
- Users should not be interrupted with approval prompts during gameplay
- You need session-based authorization for better UX

### Skip Policies When:
- Building simple applications with occasional transactions
- Manual approval for each transaction is acceptable
- You don't need gasless transaction capabilities
- You want minimal setup complexity

```typescript
// Without policies - simple setup, manual approvals
const simpleController = new Controller();

// With policies - session-based, gasless transactions
const sessionController = new Controller({
  policies: {
    // ... policy definitions
  }
});
```
